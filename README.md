GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a state-of-the-art natural language processing model that uses a transformer architecture to understand and generate human-like text. Trained on vast amounts of text data, GPT can comprehend context, generate coherent paragraphs, answer questions, and perform various language-related tasks. Its key innovation lies in its ability to generate text sequentially, making it adept at producing contextually relevant and fluent passages. GPT has gained significant attention for its capacity to mimic human language, making it a valuable tool in applications such as chatbots, content creation, language translation, and more.

Tried building a GPT with lots of help, guidance and resources.
